              Founded in 2017, HELP PEOPLE TO SAVE PEOPLE TRUST was born from a bold vision to protect the helpless, support the unheard, and bring justice, dignity, and healthcare to those left behind. Registered under the Indian Trust Act (Reg. No. 493/17), the Trust began its mission from Civil Lines, Allahabad (Prayagraj), Uttar Pradesh, under the leadership of dedicated social workers and legal professionals, led by our National President, Shashank Dhuliya.
